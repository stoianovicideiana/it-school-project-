Create an interface Vehicle with methods such as start(), stop(), and accelerate(). Create classes such as Car, Truck, and Motorcycle that implement the Vehicle interface, and implement the methods differently. Use these classes to create a traffic simulation that simulates different types of vehicles on a road.
